# memorization-tool
About: It would be great to remember anything at any time. Alas, our mental capacity is limited. 
The good thing is that there are a lot of tools to help us memorize things. 
In this project, we are going to create a tool for memorizing lines, poems, speeches, and other text-based materials.
